# notion-notebooklm-sync

[日本語](../../README.md) | English

## Overview

This system automatically retrieves pages with a "Published" (公開) flag from a Notion database, converts them into Google Docs format, and saves them to Google Drive.

The goal is to make it easier to utilize information from Notion with external AI tools like NotebookLM.

This project is implemented based on the following article (Japanese):
